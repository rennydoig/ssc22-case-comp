Must find and import from external sources. May be not feasible. \n","    * Olga and Daisy's explorations on Canada & Alberta look good.\n","    * Do we have unique CDNAME or CDUID for all provinces?\n","      * NW territories: looks good\n","      * Yukon: has only one CDNAME across the province.\n","  * Other ways to merge(dissolve) the nearest-k tiles together.\n","    * 'Spatial Regionalization': clustering where the objective is to group observations which are similar in their statistical attributes, but also in their spatial location.\n","      * Daisy's method showed that there were many clusters with only one tile.\n","  * For now, we shall use the census division.
